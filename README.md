I wanted to create a website for a group of people to allow them to browse through the books and download them.

This is the source of the same. I coded this for an organisation in my college called ISTE NITC Students' Chapter (http://istenitc.co.nf)

This website has the features of admin login and upload and it has a different filter compared to rest to check for the email ids, since I wanted it specifically for the stdents possesing nitc email id(Suffix: nitc.ac.in)

Please feel free to take any piece of code which you feel you can use. 

Please note this does not use the database connections to store and display the files. It uses text files instead.
